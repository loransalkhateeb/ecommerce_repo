## This project is a project to sell clothes via the Internet, and we used the idea of electronic commerce in it. This project is an initial project, not a final project, and we applied the concept of wireframes and mockups.

### The tools used in the project are: Firstly, I used Figma for the design, structuring of the project, and the initial visualization of the project. Secondly, I used Visual Studio Code for the purposes of implementing the project, and lastly used the distributed version control system Github to save these project on server
